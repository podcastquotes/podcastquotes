These institutions are not going away, and they're fine, they just need to rediscover a moral dimension to the consequences of their action...Our cleverness far exceeds our wisdom, and that's a problem...we've got to become wise, and we couple that with our ingenuity and our cleverness, then we'll be on the way to saving the planet, saving ourselves."
