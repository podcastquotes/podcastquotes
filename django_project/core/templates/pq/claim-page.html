            <strong>Are you a podcaster who wants to moderate your own PodcastQuotes profile page?</strong>
            <br><br>
            We give podcasters full control over the ads, promotions, and support buttons that appear on their page, and let them keep <strong>100%</strong> of the revenue generated from these links.
            <br><br>
            If you would like to receive moderator privileges for your podcast page, please tell us by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@podcastquotes.com">contact@podcastquotes.com</a> or tweeting <a href="https://www.twitter.com/pod_quotes/">@Pod_Quotes</a>, and we'll help you get started. We'll just need to verify that you are the podcaster (or authorized to act on the podcaster's behalf) before making you a moderator.
            <br><br>
            <strong>If you already have a PodcastQuotes username, you can <a href="https://www.twitter.com/home?status=hi%20%40pod_quotes%20can%20you%20make%20%5Binsert%20your%20PQ%20username%20here%5D%20a%20mod%20for%20%5Binsert%20podcast%20name%20here%5D%3F">tweet us</a> your PQ username from your official Twitter account and we will give your account moderator privileges.</strong>
            <br><br>
            If you tweet us from your official account we can use that as verification, but if you do not have a PQ username already we will need an email address to send you your username and password.
