            Inspired by <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit</a>, Podverse is an <a href="https://github.com/podcastquotes/podcastquotes/" target="_blank">open source</a> platform for sharing, voting on, and highlighting podcast episodes.</span>
            <br><br>            
            Podverse's goal is to help podcasters reach new audiences, connect with fans, and raise funds for their broadcasts. Podcasters can control the ads/promotions that appear on their page for free, and keep <span class="font-semibold">100%</span> of the revenue generated from these links, or designate them to another cause.
            <br><br>
            We'd also like this system to assist with crowdsourcing text transcripts of podcast episodes for hearing-impaired persons and researchers.
            <br><br>
            <span class="font-semibold">Podverse is under construction.</span> Your feedback would be appreciated. 
            <br><br>
            Namaste :)
