            Podverse is an <a href="https://github.com/podcastquotes/podcastquotes/" target="_blank">open source</a> podcast sharing and voting system, inspired by <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit</a>.</span>
            <br><br>            
            Podverse strives to help podcasters reach new audiences, connect with fans, and raise funds for their broadcasts. Here podcasters can set the ads/promotions that appear on their page, and keep <span class="font-semibold">100%</span> of the revenue generated from these links, or designate them to another cause.
            <br><br>
            We'd also like this system to assist with crowdsourcing text transcripts of podcast episodes for hearing-impaired persons and researchers.
