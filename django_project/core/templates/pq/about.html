            <strong>Inspired by reddit, PodcastQuotes is an <a href="https://github.com/podcastquotes/podcastquotes/">open source</a> platform to help you discover, vote on, & share highlights from your favorite podcasts.</strong>
            <br><br>
            Eventually we'd like this system to assist in crowdsourcing full text transcripts of podcast episodes, so hearing-impaired persons can enjoy podcasts too.
            <br><br>            
            PodcastQuotes is also dedicated to helping podcasters connect with fans, reach new audiences, and raise funds to sustain their show.
            <br><br>
            We want to support independent media by making it easier for podcasters to earn a living through their craft. That's why we give podcasters full control over the ads/promotions that appear on their page, and let them keep <strong>100%</strong> of the revenue generated from these links.
            <br><br>

            <strong>PodcastQuotes is currently in beta.</strong> Please let us know how the site works for you so we can improve. Thank you and namaste!
