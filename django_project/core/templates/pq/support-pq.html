            PodcastQuotes is dedicated to helping podcasters connect with fans, reach new audiences, and raise funds to sustain their show. Our goal is to support independent media, by making it easier for podcasters to earn a living through their craft.
            <br><br>
            <strong>We give podcasters full control over the ads/promotions that appear on their page, and let them keep 100% of the revenue generated from these links.</strong>
            <br><br>
            If you would like to receive moderator privileges for your podcast page, please tell us by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@podcastquotes.com">contact@podcastquotes.com</a>, and we'll help you get started. We'll just need to verify that you are the podcaster (or authorized to act on the podcaster's behalf) before making you a moderator.
