***QUOTE FILTERS***

hot - trending algorithm, along the lines of reddit's algorithm, showing the most upvoted quotes within the past X hours/days

not - reverse of the "hot" filter, showing the most downvoted quotes within the past X hours/days

controversial - along the lines of reddit's algorithm, showing the most evenly upvoted & downvoted quotes within the past X hours/days
    
ghosts - show random quotes that have 0 votes
    
new - display quotes in chronological order (like reddit does)

old - display quotes in reverse chronological order

birthdays - display quotes that were spoken on or released on the same day in a previous year or today

top - display quotes that have received the most overall upvotes, include a sub-filter (like reddit does) so you can filter the top quotes over the past hour, past 24 hours, past week, past month, past year, or custom range

bottom - reverse of the "top" filter, uses the same sub-filter as "top"

mainstream - display quotes that have received the most overall upvotes and downvotes

custom - tbd, advanced user-customizable filters



***VOTE FILTERS***

All Votes - show all votes, no filter

Verified Votes - show only the votes of verified user accounts...eventually it may be desirable for this to be the smart default vote filter, since "All Votes" can be more easily manipulated

Listener Votes - show only the votes of listeners of the podcast that is quoted

Anonymous Votes - show only the votes of anonymous user accounts

Troll Votes - show only the votes of user accounts that have been labeled by community or self-identified as a "Troll"

Unverified Votes - show only the votes of unverified user accounts
